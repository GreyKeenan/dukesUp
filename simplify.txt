Areas to simplify, and how
==================================================

Runs/sets
--------------------------------------------------

The suits for runs is the main way to simplify runs/sets.
Options could be:

* suits dont matter
* (current) spades/diamonds hearts/clubs


Drawing
--------------------------------------------------

When drawing cards,
the *number* you draw
and *where* you draw from
are two factors that compound complexity.

For simplifying the number, we could do:

* draw up to a limit
* draw 1, up to a limit
* (current) draw 2, up to a limit

For simplifying the where-from, could consider:

* draw from draw pile only
* (current) draw from draw or discard pile


Discarding
--------------------------------------------------

This is the main target of simplification imo.
Currently, there are *4* ways to discard,
and each of them have unique rules to consider.

Currently, you can:

* 1 from hand
* 2 from hand
  * ONLY if you do nothing else
* 1 from board
  * valid before
  * valid after
* 1 from draw
  * CANT look at it
  * to BOTTOM of discard

A proposal:

* discard 1 card to end your turn.
* This may be taken from:
  * your hand
  * yours from the table
    * ?valid arrangement?
  * your draw pile
    * cant look at it
    * ~~bottom of discard~~
* If you do nothing on your turn,
  you may discard twice.

Alternatively

* you can discard two/twice whenever
* not discarding to the bottom of the pile
  when you burn,
  This is worse strategically,
  but potentially worth it.
* Find an alternative mechanic for
  removing cards from the board.
  That way, it doesnt have to add complexity to discarding.
* The same, but for burning?
  No, that doesnt really make sense.
  The point of burning is:
  1) avoid discarding cards you want
  2) introduce uncertainty as to what is in your deck.

  Perhaps burning could be removed,
  and another mechanism for uncertainty added.
  That might just be annoying though.
* Are there alternatives to discarding entirely?
  Like, is there some other entire thing which
  could fill a similar purpose.
  Don't get stuck thinking in terms of
  traditional discarding mechanics.
  I mean, that might be a bit of a semantics game though.
