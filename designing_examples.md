Designing Examples
==================================================

An internal document
about creating the gameplay examples
for the rules.

<br>

<!-- INDEX -->
* Syntax
* Goals
* Edge cases or problem areas to depict

<br>

Syntax
==================================================

Cards will be denoted in the form:
`[value][suit]`

Examples:

* `9h` = 9 of hearts
* `Ad` = ace of diamonds
* `10s` = 10 of spades
  * alternatively `Ts` when character count is important
* `Qc` = queen of clubs


Goals
==================================================

Good examples can go a along way.
They help convey the general vibe,
they can convey visual information,
...,
and they can depict edge cases without
needing to dedicate space
to fully explain corners.

That last aspect is one of the main focuses
of this document.
I want to make sure to include
as much of that as possible.


coverage
========================================

edge cases or little details
which are better communicated in examples

* aces: high or low
* aces: *but not both*
* taking the CASTLE "before" taking its guards,
  within the same turn.
* leaving your DUKE empty

the actual things to cover

* examples of melds
* "valid states" of the board
* playing melds
* taking DUKES
* taking CASTLES
* using your DUKE
* using your CASTLE
* discarding off of the board
* just, a really complex rearrange
* negative examples?
  * failed rearrange
  * invalid arrangements
  * failing to play your CASTLE
