Dukes Up!
==================================================

> by Grey and Sam

"Dukes Up!" is a two-player card game
played with a standard deck.
Inspired by "Rummy 100",
players arrange runs/sets on the table
while trying to protect their CASTLES.
Once you learn how to play,
a single game takes about 15 minutes.

> A video tutorial is on the way.

Overview
==================================================

Each player has a card called their "CASTLE".
Your goal is to take the opponent's CASTLE
by playing it in a run/set.
However, cards called "DUKES" protect the CASTLE,
and must be taken first.

    />
  </a>
</div>


Setup
==================================================

1. Remove jokers and split the deck by color.
  Give one player all the clubs/spades,
  and the other hearts/diamonds.
1. Shuffle your half of the deck
  and set it aside as your draw pile.
  Draw 4 cards.
1. Select 1 of the 4 cards as your CASTLE,
  and place it face-down on the table.
  Select 2 cards as your DUKES,
  and place them face-down in front of the CASTLE.
  The left-over card will be part of your starting hand.
1. Once both players pick their DUKES,
  they say, "Dukes Up!" and flip them face-up in unison.
  The CASTLES remain face-down for now.

From here, the first player can start their turn.

</div>

Taking Your Turn
==================================================

Start your turn by drawing.
Draw 2 cards at most,
but your hand can't have more than 4 cards.
If your draw pile is empty,
shuffle your discard pile.

Then, if you have no DUKES,
you *must* flip your CASTLE face-up.
Once up, it can be taken by the opponent.

Next, you can play.
Take any combination of the following actions:

* Create runs/sets using cards from your hand,
  using the opponent's DUKES/CASTLE,
  or by rearranging cards on the table.
  > (See ["Runs, Sets, and Rearranging Cards"](#runs-sets-and-rearranging-cards))
* Switch out your remaining DUKES with cards from your hand.
  [\*](examples.html#defending)
* If you have *no* DUKES,
  create a new DUKE with a card from your hand.


Last, you must discard to end your turn.
Players have their own discard piles.
Choose one of the following:

* Discard a card from your hand.
* Discard a card from your draw pile.
  Do not look at it.
* Discard 1 of your-color cards off of the table.
  The remaining cards must be in valid runs/sets.
  [\*](examples.html#discarding-off-the-table)

If you don't play on your turn,
you can discard twice.

Discarding ends your turn.
The opponent can draw to start the next turn.


Runs, Sets, and Rearranging Cards
--------------------------------------------------

A set is a group of 3+ cards
with the same value.

A run is a group of 3+ cards
with sequential values
and coordinated suits.
In "Dukes Up!",
spades/diamonds go together
and clubs/hearts go together.

An easy way to remember which suits go together
is to look at the suit symbol.
If the top is pointed, it's a "thorn";
if it's rounded, it's a "flower".
Thorns go with thorns, and flowers go with flowers.

`set:` 5&#9824;, 5&#9825;, 5&#9826; \
`run of thorns:` A&#9824;, 2&#9824;, 3&#9824;, 4&#9824; \
`run of thorns:` 8&#9826;, 9&#9826;, 10&#9824; \
`run of flowers:` 10&#9827;, J&#9827;, Q&#9825;, K&#9825;, A&#9827; \
`INVALID run:` 5&#9827;, 6&#9824;, 7&#9824; \
`INVALID run:` 6&#9825;, 8&#9825;, 9&#9825;

If you can make a run/set with cards from your hand,
you can play it to the table.
Additionally, if you can make a run/set with the opponent's DUKES,
you can take their DUKE and play it to the table.

    />
  </a>
</div>

> Red creates a run of thorns to take Black's 8&#9824; DUKE.


Similarly, if you can use the opponent's
face-up CASTLE in a run/set,
you can take it.
This ends the game.
**But**, to take a CASTLE,
you must take any DUKES guarding it
in that same turn.

<div style="text-align: center">
  <a href="assets/takeFief_pre.jpg" target="_blank">
    <img
      width="49%"
      src="assets/takeFief_pre.jpg"
      alt="complex play, part 1"
    />
  </a>
  <a href="assets/takeFief_post.jpg" target="_blank">
    <img
      width="49%"
      src="assets/takeFief_post.jpg"
      alt="complex play, part 1"
    />
  </a>
</div>

> Red takes Black's J&#9827; CASTLE to end the game.
  Notice that the 3&#9827; DUKE must be taken as well.

Finally, as the above example demonstrates,
remember that you can rearrange existing runs/sets.
However, before you discard,
*all cards on the table
must be in valid runs/sets*.
In other words, when you're arranging runs/sets,
cards cannot be left out.


Ending the Game
==================================================

Once you take the opponent's CASTLE,
the game ends.
Alternatively, if your draw and discard piles are both empty,
the game ends.

Players get 1 point for each card of their color on the table.
(This includes cards in runs/sets,
remaining DUKES, and remaining CASTLES.)
The player who eliminated their opponent's CASTLE
gets a 3 point bonus.
The higher score wins.


Extra Rules
==================================================

Once you've played a couple times,
we *highly* recommend adding these rules
for balancing (and fun-ness) purposes.

* On the first player's first turn,
  they can't switch out their DUKES.
* When you draw cards at the start of your turn,
  you can choose to draw from your discard pile instead.
  Then, when you discard a card from your draw pile,
  place it on the *bottom* of your discard pile.
* On your final turn,
  you can use your CASTLE in a run/set.
  If you can't end the game in that turn,
  you must return your CASTLE to its position, face-up.


More Examples
==================================================

If you're still confused,
hopefully this will help.
