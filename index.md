Dukes Up!
==================================================

> by Grey and Sam

"Dukes Up!" is a two-player game
played with a standard 52-card deck.
Inspired by "Rummy 100",
players arrange runs/sets on the table,
while trying to protect their CASTLES.
Once you learn how to play,
a single game takes about 15 minutes.

Setup
--------------------------------------------------

1. Split the deck in half by color.
  One player takes clubs/spades;
  the other gets hearts/diamonds.
1. Shuffle your half of the deck,
  and draw 4 cards.
  Set the remaining cards aside as your draw pile.
1. Select 1 of the 4 cards as your CASTLE,
  and place it face-down on the table.
  Select 2 cards as your DUKES,
  and place them face-down in front of the CASTLE.
  The remaining card will be part of your starting hand.
1. Once both players have selected their DUKES,
  they say, "Dukes Up!" in unison and flip up their DUKES.
  The CASTLES remain face-down for now.

From here, the first player can start their turn.


Taking Your Turn
--------------------------------------------------

Start your turn by drawing.
Draw up to 2 cards,
but you can't have more than 4 cards.
If your draw pile is empty,
reshuffle your discard pile.

Next, if you have no DUKES,
you must flip your CASTLE face-up.


Then, you can play.
Take any combination of the following actions:

* Create runs/sets using cards from your hand,
  the opponent's DUKES, or by rearranging cards on the table.
  > (See "Runs, Sets, and Rearranging Cards" below)
* Swap out your remaining DUKES with cards from your hand.
* If you have *no* DUKES,
  create a single DUKE with a card from your hand.


Finally, you must discard to end your turn.
Choose one of the following options:

* Discard a card from your hand.
* Discard the top card of your draw pile.
  Do not look at it.
* Discard 1 of your-color cards off of the table.
  The remaining cards must all be in valid runs/sets.

If you don't play on your turn,
you may discard twice instead of once.

Discarding ends your turn.
The opponent is free to draw and start the next turn.


### Runs, Sets, and Rearranging Cards

<!--
* runs/sets, valid arrangement
* rearranging
-->


Ending the Game
--------------------------------------------------

Once you take the opponent's CASTLE,
the game ends.
Alternatively, if your draw and discard piles are both empty,
the game ends.

Players get 1 point for each card of their color on the table.
(This includes cards in runs/sets,
remaining DUKES, and remaining CASTLES.)
The player who eliminated their opponent's CASTLE
gets a 3 point bonus.
The higher score wins.

Extra Balancing Rules
--------------------------------------------------

Once you are more familiar with the game,
we *highly* recommend adding these rules
for balancing (and fun-ness) purposes.

<!--
* no swapping turn 1
* draw from discard ? maybe as default rule
* burning to bottom of discard
* playing your CASTLE
-->
