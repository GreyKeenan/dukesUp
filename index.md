Dukes Up!
==================================================

> by Samuel Grey Keenan and Samuel Olaf Keenan

"Dukes Up!" is a 2-player card game.
All you need is a standard deck of cards and a bit of table space.
It's a great option for those familiar with rummy-style games who want to mix it up.
A single game of "Dukes Up!" takes around 15-20 minutes.

We are currently working on a video tutorial and visual aids.

Setup
==================================================

1. Choose a player to go first.
If you are playing multiple games, switch back and forth.
1. Split the deck in half by color.
One player gets clubs/spades, and the other gets hearts/diamonds.
Remove the jokers.
1. Shuffle your half of the deck and draw 4 cards.
Set the remaining cards aside as your draw pile.
Players have their own draw and discard piles.
1. Choose 1 of the 4 cards as your FIEF, and place it face-down on the table.
Choose 2 cards as your DUKES, and place them face-down in front of your FIEF.
The left-over card will be part of your starting hand.
1. Leave space on the table for the "play area".
1. Once both players have chosen their cards,
they say, “Dukes Up!” and flip up their DUKES in unison.
The FIEFS remain face-down.
1. From here, the chosen first player can start their turn.
Taking your turn is explained below.

Objective
==================================================

Your goal is to take the opponent's FIEF.

Throughout the game, you play cards to the table in runs and sets.
You can take the opponent's cards by playing them in the same way.
Once someone's FIEF is taken, the game ends,
and the player who played the most cards wins.


Runs and Sets
==================================================

Runs and sets are ways to group cards together.
In "Dukes Up!" and many other rummy-style games,
creating runs/sets allows you to play cards to the table.
This will be described in more depth later.
<!--
If you're completely unfamiliar with runs and sets,
this game might be a bit confusing,
but we'll do our best to explain.
-->

- A set is a group of 3+ cards with the same value.
- A run is a group of 3+ cards in sequential order with coordinating suits.
Runs can be **spades/diamonds** or **clubs/hearts**. \
(Aces can be high or low, but not both.)

Here's a tip for remembering which suits go together.
Think of them as "thorns" and "flowers".
If the top of the suit is pointed, it's a "thorn".
If it's rounded, it's a "flower".

Valid and invalid examples:

- `king of clubs, king of diamonds, king of hearts, king of spades` is a set of kings.
- `ten of spades, ten of clubs` is **not** a valid set, since it must be at least 3 cards.
- `nine of clubs, ten of clubs, jack of hearts, queen of clubs` is a run of clubs/hearts.
- `ace of diamonds, two of diamonds, three of diamonds` is a run of spades/diamonds.
- `two of spades, three of spades, four of clubs` is **not** a valid run, since spades/clubs cannot be combined.


Take Your Turn
==================================================

There are a few things to do on your turn.

1. Start your turn by drawing.
1. Then, perform any of the following actions:
	* Play cards
	* Rearrange runs/sets
	* Take the opponent's DUKES
	* Swap out your DUKES
	* Protect your FIEF
1. End your turn by discading.

Draw
--------------------------------------------------

Start your turn by drawing *up to* 2 cards,
as long as you won't have more than 4 cards.

You can draw from your draw pile or your discard pile,
but not both in the same turn.

If your draw pile is empty,
shuffle your discard pile into a new draw pile.


Play Cards
--------------------------------------------------

It's important to play cards to the table
in order to gain points and take the opponent's cards.

When you can form runs/sets from the cards in your hand,
you can play them to the table.
You can play cards which add to existing runs/sets as well.

Once runs/sets have been played,
they are not "owned" by either player.
You may add on to the opponent's runs/sets,
and they may add on to yours.

In addition to cards from your hand,
you can sometimes play the opponent's DUKES or FIEF to the table. \
(See "Taking the Opponent's DUKES".)


Rearrange Cards
--------------------------------------------------

You can rearrange the runs/sets in play to change the layout of the table.
This is where much of the game's strategy comes from,
as it allows you to get the opponent's cards stuck.

For a simple example, say a run of `three, four, five, six` is already on the table, and you have two sixes in your hand.
You may separate the six on the table from its run and combine it with the sixes from your hand to create a set of sixes.
The table would now have a run (`three, four, five`) and a set of sixes.
This is considered a "valid arrangement" since all cards are part of a run or set.

When rearranging cards, there are 2 rules you must follow:

1. You cannot remove cards from play.
For instance, you cannot pick up a card that was played on a previous turn and put it in your hand.
2. Before discarding, all cards in play must be part of a run or set.
<!-- example of not this? -->


Take the Opponent's DUKES
--------------------------------------------------

FIEFS start the game face-down and protected.
Before you can take the opponent's FIEF,
you have to get through the DUKES that are guarding it.

To take one of the opponent's DUKES,
play it in a valid run/set, just like cards from your hand.

Once both of a player's DUKES are gone,
their FIEF must be flipped up *at the start of their next turn*.
Now, it's vulnerable.
It can be taken and played in runs/sets like a DUKE,
with a catch. \
(See "Ending the Game".)


Swap Out Your DUKES
--------------------------------------------------

In order to protect your own DUKES,
you can swap them out.
Just pick up the original DUKE and put it in your hand.
Then, use a card from your hand to replace it.

When you pick up a DUKE, you do not *have* to replace it.
You may choose to leave it empty instead,
but it cannot be replaced on a later turn.
If you leave both DUKES empty,
you must flip up your FIEF *at the start of your next turn*,
just like if the opponent took them.

**The first player's first turn is a special case.**
On this turn, you can only swap out DUKES if you play the original DUKE in a run/set.
You cannot just pick up a DUKE and put it in your hand.

*You cannot swap out your FIEF like a DUKE.


Protect Your FIEF
--------------------------------------------------

Finally, there is a way to protect your FIEF once it is face-up.

Each turn, if your FIEF is face-up and you have no DUKES otherwise,
you may use a card from your hand to create a single DUKE.

You cannot get both of your DUKES back at any point,
and you cannot create DUKES when your FIEF is face-down.


Discard
--------------------------------------------------

To end your turn, you must discard.
Cards are discarded face-down to your own discard pile.

You have four options when discarding:

1. Discard 1 card from your hand to the top of your discard pile.
	> This is the most basic option.
2. Discard 2 cards from your hand to the top of your discard pile.
This can only be done if you perform no other actions during your turn.
You cannot play, replace DUKES, or take the opponent's DUKES.
	> Generally, if you aren't able to play anyways,
	this is a good choice.
3. Discard 1 card from the top of your draw pile to the *bottom* of your discard pile.
You cannot look at it.
	> We like to call this "burning".
	It allows you to hold on to important cards,
	but it comes at the cost of not knowing what you discarded.
4. Discard 1 of *your own* cards from the play area to the top of your discard pile.
You can only do this if it leaves a valid arrangement of runs and sets behind.
Remember that runs/sets must be in a valid arrangement *before* you discard, as well.
	> This is a valuable tool for defensive play,
	but you are losing a point each time you use it.

Once you discard, your turn is over.
The other player may draw to start their turn.

*You cannot look back through your discard pile.


Ending the Game
==================================================

Take the opponent's FIEF to end the game.

Once the opponent's FIEF is face-up,
you can play it in runs/sets.
However, you *must* take any DUKES guarding it in the same turn.
Taking the FIEF ends the game;
move on to scoring.

Alternatively, if your draw and discard piles are both empty,
meaining all of your cards are on the table or in your hand,
the game ends.
You may play any additional cards from your hand before moving on to scoring.


Playing Your FIEF
--------------------------------------------------

Sometimes, the easiest way to take the opponent's FIEF is to use your own.

You can attempt to play your own FIEF in order to take the opponent's and end the game.
Because you are playing your own FIEF, you *must* take the opponent's in this turn.
You cannot end the game by eliminating your own FIEF.

To use your FIEF, play it in runs/sets just like any other card.
If you are unable to take the opponent's FIEF, you must return your FIEF to its position, *face-up*.


Scoring
==================================================

At the end of the game, the player with the most cards on the table wins.
Count up remaining DUKES, remaining FIEFS, and cards in runs/sets.
All cards of your color are considered yours.
