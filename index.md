Dukes Up!
==================================================

> by Samuel Grey Keenan and Samuel Olaf Keenan

"Dukes Up!" is a semi-strategic, 2-player card game played with a standard deck of cards. It uses rummy-style elements which will be familiar to card players, and it has a bit more depth than many 2-player classics. You can play "Dukes Up!" as a single round, in about 15-20 minutes, or you can play multiple rounds in a tournament style.

Setup
==================================================

1. Split the deck in half by color. One player gets clubs + spades, and the other gets hearts + diamonds. Jokers can be removed.
2. Choose a player to go first. If you are playing multiple rounds, switch back and forth.
3. Each shuffle your half of the deck and draw 4 cards. Set the remaining cards aside as your draw pile. Players have their own draw and discard piles.
4. Choose 1 of the 4 cards as your CASTLE, and place it face down on the table. Choose 2 cards as your DUKES, and place them face down in front of your CASTLE. The left-over card will be part of your starting hand.
5. The rest of the table serves as a playing area, where runs and sets will be played.
6. Once both players have chosen their DUKES, they say, “Dukes Up!” in unison and flip up their DUKES. The CASTLES remain face-down.


Objective
==================================================

Throughout the game, players' cards are played to the tabe in runs and sets. At the end of the game, the player who has the most cards on the table wins. You can easily tell players' cards apart by color.

The game ends when you play your opponent's CASTLE in a run/set. However, the DUKES protect the CASTLE, and they must be played first.

Thus, your goal is to (1) play cards to the table in runs or sets to gain points, (2) play your opponents' DUKES and CASTLE to the table in order to end the game, and (3) protect your own CASTLE by selecting strong DUKES.


Runs and Sets
==================================================

Runs and sets are a common mechanic in traditional card games, though they can vary slightly between different games. Runs and sets are defined for "Dukes Up!" as follows:

- Valid sets are groups of 3 or more cards, all with the same value.
- Valid runs are groups of 3 or more cards, all of the same suit, with their values in sequential order.

Importantly, "Dukes Up!" uses different suits than the traditional 4 (clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds). "Dukes Up!" groups suits together to create THORNS and FLOWERS.

- The THORNS suit consists of spades and diamonds.
- The FLOWERS suit consists of clubs and hearts.

This means that valid runs can contain either clubs & hearts or spades & diamonds. Additionally, notice that each player's deck has half of both suits.

An easy trick to remember the suits is to look at the top of the suit symbol. If the top is pointed, it is a THORN. If the top is rounded, it is a FLOWER.


Taking Your Turn
==================================================

You begin your turn by drawing.

Next, you may perform any of the following actions:

- Play cards from your hand.
- Rearrange runs/sets.
- Take your opponent's DUKES.
- Replace your own DUKES.

Finally, you must discard to end your turn.


Drawing
--------------------------------------------------

You can draw up to 2 cards, ensuring that your hand does not exceed 4 cards. You may choose to draw from your draw pile or your discard pile, but not both in the same turn.

If your draw pile is empty, shuffle your discard pile into a new draw pile.


Playing Cards
--------------------------------------------------

On your turn, you can play cards from your hand to the table. These may be new runs/sets, or they may add to existing runs/sets.

You may also be able to play your opponent's DUKES to the table in the same way. (see "Taking Your Opponent's DUKES")


Rearranging Cards
--------------------------------------------------

At any point before discarding, you can rearrange the runs or sets in play to change the layout of the table and give yourself more options.

For example, say a run of `three->four->five->six` is already on the table, and you have two sixes in your hand. You may separate the six on the table from its run, and combine it with the sixes from your hand to create a set of sixes. The table would now have a run of 3 and a set of sixes, which is a valid arrangement.

When rearranging cards, there are 2 rules you must follow:

1. You cannot remeove cards from play.
2. Before discarding, all cards in play must be part of valid runs or sets.

> (visual aids needed)

Rearranging cards is where much of the strategy comes from. It allows you to change the board to be less favorable to your opponent by getting cards stuck in runs/sets.


Taking Your Opponent's DUKES
--------------------------------------------------

~~~
TODO

- when both of an opponents DUKES are taken, they must flip up their CASTLE at the start of their next turn.
~~~


Replacing Your DUKES
--------------------------------------------------

At any point before discarding, you can swap out your DUKES with other cards in your hand. This cannot be done on the first player's first turn, however.

You do not *have* to replace your dukes. You may choose to leave them empty.

Additionally, each turn, if your CASTLE is face up and you have no DUKES, you may replace a single DUKE.

~~~
TODO

- face-up castle and dukes can be played simultaneously.
~~~


Discarding
--------------------------------------------------

To end your turn, you must discard. Cards are discarded face-down so that the opponent cannot see them.

Discard in any 1 of the following ways:

- Discard 1 card from your hand to the top of your discard pile.
- Discard 2 cards from your hand to the top of your discard pile. This can only be done if you perform no other actions during your turn. You cannot play, swap out dukes, or take your opponent's dukes.
- Discard 1 card from the top of your draw pile to the *bottom* of your discard pile. You cannot look at it.
- Discard 1 of your own cards from the play area to the top of your discard pile. You can only do this if it leaves a valid arrangement of runs and sets behind. Remember that the runs/sets must be in a valid arrangement *before* you can discard as well.

You cannot look back through your discard pile.
