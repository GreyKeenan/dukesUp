Dukes Up!
==================================================

> by Samuel Grey Keenan and Samuel Olaf Keenan

"Dukes Up!" is a semi-strategic, 2-player card game played with a standard deck of cards. It uses rummy-style elements which will be familiar to card players, and it has a bit more depth than many 2-player classics. You can play "Dukes Up!" as a single game, in about 15-20 minutes, or you can play multiple games in a tournament style.

Setup
==================================================

1. Choose a player to go first.
If you are playing multiple games, switch back and forth.
2. Split the deck in half by color.
One player gets clubs/spades, and the other gets hearts/diamonds.
Remove the jokers.
3. Shuffle your half of the deck and draw 4 cards.
Set the remaining cards aside as your draw pile.
Players have their own draw and discard piles.
4. Choose 1 of the 4 cards as your CASTLE, and place it face-down on the table.
Choose 2 cards as your DUKES, and place them face-down in front of your CASTLE.
The left-over card will be part of your starting hand.
5. Runs and sets will be played to the rest of the table.
6. Once both players have chosen their DUKES, they say, “Dukes Up!” in unison and flip up their DUKES.
The CASTLES remain face-down, and should be secret.


Objective
==================================================

Throughout the game, cards are played to the table in runs and sets.
At the end of the game, the player who has the most cards on the table wins.

The game ends when you play your opponent's CASTLE.
However, the DUKES protect the CASTLE, and they must be played first.

Your goals are to play the most cards,
take your opponent's CASTLE,
and protect your own CASTLE.


Runs and Sets
==================================================

<!--

Runs and sets are a common mechanic in traditional card games, though they can vary between games. Runs and sets are defined for "Dukes Up!" as follows:

- Valid sets are groups of 3 or more cards, all with the same value.
- Valid runs are groups of 3 or more cards, all of the same suit, with their values in sequential order.

Importantly, "Dukes Up!" uses different suits than the traditional 4 (clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds). "Dukes Up!" groups suits together to create THORNS and FLOWERS.

- The THORNS suit consists of spades and diamonds.
- The FLOWERS suit consists of clubs and hearts.

This means that players' decks contain half of both suits.

Realistically, suits are only relevant for creating runs.
THORNS and FLOWERS mean that runs can contain either clubs & hearts or spades & diamonds.

An easy trick to remember the suits is to look at the top of the suit symbol. If the top is pointed, it is a THORN. If the top is rounded, it is a FLOWER.


Taking Your Turn
==================================================

You begin your turn by drawing.

Next, you may perform any of the following actions:

- Play cards from your hand.
- Rearrange runs/sets.
- Take your opponent's DUKES.
- Replace your own DUKES.

Finally, you must discard to end your turn.


Drawing
--------------------------------------------------

You can draw up to 2 cards, ensuring that your hand does not exceed 4 cards.
You may draw from your draw pile or your discard pile, but not both in the same turn.

If your draw pile is empty, shuffle your discard pile into a new draw pile.


Playing Cards
--------------------------------------------------

On your turn, you can play cards from your hand to the table. These may be new runs/sets, or they may add to existing runs/sets.

Sometimes, you can play your opponent's DUKES to the table.
See "Taking Your Opponent's DUKES".


Rearranging Cards
--------------------------------------------------

At any point before discarding, you can rearrange the runs or sets in play to change the layout of the table.
This can give you more options and is where much of the game's strategy comes from.

For a simple example, say a run of `three->four->five->six` is already on the table, and you have two sixes in your hand.
You may separate the six on the table from its run, and combine it with the sixes from your hand to create a set of sixes.
The table would now have a run of 3 and a set of sixes, which is a valid arrangement.

When rearranging cards, there are 2 rules you must follow:

1. You cannot remove cards from play.
For instance, you could not pick up a card that was played on a previous turn, and return it to your hand.
2. Before discarding, all cards in play must be part of valid runs or sets.


Taking Your Opponent's DUKES
--------------------------------------------------

The DUKES protect the CASTLE, and they must be played before the CASTLE can be played.

You can use your opponent's DUKES in much the same way as your own cards.
They can be taken and played to the table as parts of runs/sets.
If possible, you are allowed to take both DUKES in a single turn.

Once both of a player's DUKES have been taken, they must flip up their CASTLE *at the start of their next turn*.

They will eventually have an opportunity to replace their DUKES.
See "Replacing Your DUKES".

A *face-up* CASTLE can be played to the table just like a DUKE,
except that any DUKE guarding it must also be taken within the same turn.
Taking an opponent's CASTLE ends the game.
See "Ending the Game".


Replacing Your DUKES
--------------------------------------------------

During your turn, your DUKES are interchangeable with cards from your hand.
You can swap them freely.

The first player's *first turn* is a special case.
They can only replace their DUKES if they play them to the table in that turn.
	<!-- On that turn, they cannot freely exchange DUKES with cards from their hand. -->

Whenever you use your DUKES, you don't *have* to replace them.
You may choose to leave them empty,
but they cannot be replaced on later turns.
If you leave both DUKES empty, you must flip up your CASTLE *at the start of your next turn.*

When your CASTLE is face-down, you cannot replace DUKES that were taken by your opponent.
However, each turn, if your CASTLE is face-up and you have no DUKES, you may add a single DUKE.
You *cannot* add back both of your DUKES.

You are not allowed to swap out your CASTLE.


Discarding
--------------------------------------------------

To end your turn, you must discard. Cards are discarded face-down to your own discard pile.

There are four ways to discard:

1. Discard 1 card from your hand to the top of your discard pile.
2. Discard 2 cards from your hand to the top of your discard pile.
This can only be done if you perform no other actions during your turn.
You cannot play, swap out dukes, or take your opponent's dukes.
3. Discard 1 card from the top of your draw pile to the *bottom* of your discard pile.
You cannot look at it.
4. Discard 1 of *your own* cards from the play area to the top of your discard pile.
You can only do this if it leaves a valid arrangement of runs and sets behind.
Remember that the runs/sets must be in a valid arrangement *before* you discard, as well.

Once you discard, your turn is over, and the other player may draw to start their turn.

You cannot look back through your discard pile.


Ending the Game
==================================================

In order to take an opponent's CASTLE, it must be face-up, and any DUKE guarding it must be taken in the same turn.
At this point, the game is over.
The attacking player gets a chance to play any additional cards from their hand before moving on to scoring.

Additionally, if a player empties both their draw and discard piles, meaning all of their cards are either on the table or in their hand, the game is over.
The attacking player gets a chance to play any additional cards from their hand before moving on to scoring.


Playing Your CASTLE
--------------------------------------------------

This is a special move you can use to end the game.

You cannot intentionally eliminate your own CASTLE to end the game.
However, you can attempt to play your own CASTLE in order to take the opponent's.
You must take the opponent's CASTLE in this turn.

If your CASTLE is face-up, this can be done easily.
Simply grab the CASTLE and play it to the board just as any other card.
If you made a mistake and you are unable to take your opponent's CASTLE, you must put your CASTLE back and return the table to a valid state.

If your CASTLE is face-down, you must flip it up to make this move.
If you are then unable to take your opponent's CASTLE, your CASTLE remains face-up.


Scoring
==================================================

At the end of the game, the player with the most cards on the table wins.
Any cards of your color are considered yours.
This includes any cards in runs/sets, as well as any remaining CASTLES and DUKES.
All cards count as 1.
