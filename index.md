Dukes Up!
==================================================

> by Grey and Sam

"Dukes Up!" is a two-player game
played with a standard 52-card deck.
Inspired by "Rummy 100",
players arrange runs/sets on the table,
while trying to protect their CASTLES.
Once you learn how to play,
a single game takes about 15 minutes.

-->

<!-- image: basic table layout -->

Setup
--------------------------------------------------

1. Split the deck in half by color.
  One player takes clubs/spades;
  the other gets hearts/diamonds.
1. Shuffle your half of the deck,
  and draw 4 cards.
  Set the remaining cards aside as your draw pile.
1. Select 1 of the 4 cards as your CASTLE,
  and place it face-down on the table.
  Select 2 cards as your DUKES,
  and place them face-down in front of the CASTLE.
  The remaining card will be part of your starting hand.
1. Once both players have selected their DUKES,
  they say, "Dukes Up!" in unison and flip up their DUKES.
  The CASTLES remain face-down for now.

From here, the first player can start their turn.


Taking Your Turn
--------------------------------------------------

<!--
1. draw
1. flip CASTLE
1. play cards
1. rearrange
1. take dukes
1. replace dukes
1. discard
-->

First, start your turn by drawing
from your draw pile.
Draw up to 2 cards,
but you can't have more than 4 cards.

Next, if you have no DUKES,
flip your CASTLE face-up.


...


Finally, you must discard to end your turn.
Choose one of the following options:

* Discard a card from your hand.
* Discard the top card of your draw pile.
  Do not look at it.
* Discard 1 of your-color cards off of the table.
  The remaining cards must all be in valid runs/sets.

If you do nothing else on your turn,
you may discard twice instead of once.

Discarding ends your turn.
The opponent is free to draw and start their turn.


Ending the Game
--------------------------------------------------

Once you are more familiar with the game,
we *highly* recommend adding these rules
for balancing (and fun-ness) purposes.

* draw from discard
* burning to bottom of discard
* playing your CASTLE
