Dukes Up!
==================================================

> by Samuel Grey Keenan and Samuel Olaf Keenan

"Dukes Up!" is a 2-player card game played with a standard deck of cards.
It uses rummy-style elements which will be familiar to card players, but it has a more depth than many other 2-player options.
You can play "Dukes Up!" as a single game, in about 15-20 minutes, or you can play multiple games in a tournament style.

A video tutorial and visual aids are in the works.

Setup
==================================================

1. Choose a player to go first.
If you are playing multiple games, switch back and forth.
2. Split the deck in half by color.
One player gets clubs/spades, and the other gets hearts/diamonds.
Remove the jokers.
3. Shuffle your half of the deck and draw 4 cards.
Set the remaining cards aside as your draw pile.
Players have their own draw and discard piles.
4. Choose 1 of the 4 cards as your CASTLE, and place it face-down on the table.
Choose 2 cards as your DUKES, and place them face-down in front of your CASTLE.
The left-over card will be part of your starting hand.
5. Runs and sets will be played to the rest of the table.
6. Once both players have chosen their DUKES, they say, “Dukes Up!” in unison and flip up their DUKES.
The CASTLES remain face-down, and should be secret.


Objective
==================================================

Throughout the game, cards are played to the table in runs and sets.
At the end of the game, the player who has the most cards on the table wins.

The game ends when you play the opponent's CASTLE.
However, the DUKES protect the CASTLE, and they must be played first.

Your goals are to play the most cards,
take the opponent's CASTLE,
and protect your own CASTLE.


Runs and Sets
==================================================

Runs and sets are a common mechanic in traditional card games, though they can vary between games. Runs and sets are defined for "Dukes Up!" as follows:

- Valid sets are groups of 3 or more cards, all with the same value.
- Valid runs are groups of 3 or more cards, all of the same suit, with their values in sequential order.

Importantly, "Dukes Up!" uses different suits than the traditional 4 (clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds). "Dukes Up!" groups suits together to create THORNS and FLOWERS.

- The THORNS suit consists of spades and diamonds.
- The FLOWERS suit consists of clubs and hearts.

This means that players' decks contain half of both suits.

Realistically, suits are only relevant for creating runs.
THORNS and FLOWERS mean that runs can contain either clubs & hearts or spades & diamonds.

An easy trick to remember the suits is to look at the top of the suit symbol. If the top is pointed, it is a THORN. If the top is rounded, it is a FLOWER.


Taking Your Turn
==================================================

You begin your turn by drawing.

Next, you may perform any of the following actions:

- Play cards from your hand.
- Rearrange runs/sets.
- Take the opponent's DUKES.
- Replace your own DUKES.

Finally, you must discard to end your turn.


Drawing
--------------------------------------------------

Start your turn by drawing up to 2 cards, ensuring that your hand does not exceed 4 cards.
You may draw from your draw pile or your discard pile, but not both in the same turn.

If your draw pile is empty, shuffle your discard pile into a new draw pile.


Playing Cards
--------------------------------------------------

You may play cards from your hand to the table in runs/sets.
The cards may be new runs/sets, or they may add to existing runs/sets.

Sometimes, you can play the opponent's DUKES to the table.
See "Taking the Opponent's DUKES".


Rearranging Cards
--------------------------------------------------

At any point before discarding, you may rearrange the runs/sets in play to change the layout of the table.
This is where much of the game's strategy comes from.

For a simple example, say a run of `three->four->five->six` is already on the table, and you have two sixes in your hand.
You may separate the six on the table from its run, and combine it with the sixes from your hand to create a set of sixes.
The table would now have a run of 3 and a set of sixes, which is a valid arrangement.

When rearranging cards, there are 2 rules you must follow:

1. You cannot remove cards from play.
For instance, you cannot pick up a card that was played on a previous turn and put it in your hand.
2. Before discarding, all cards in play must be part of a valid run or set.


Taking the Opponent's DUKES
--------------------------------------------------

Recall that DUKES protect the CASTLE, and they must be taken before the CASTLE can be taken.

You may take the opponent's DUKES by playing them runs/sets, just like cards from your hand.
If possible, you are allowed to take both DUKES in a single turn.

Once both of a player's DUKES have been taken, they must flip up their CASTLE *at the start of their next turn*.
Keep in mind that they will have an opportunity to add new DUKES once their CASTLE is face-up.
See "Replacing Your DUKES".

A *face-up* CASTLE can be played to the table just like a DUKE,
except that any DUKE guarding it must be taken in that same turn.
Taking an opponent's CASTLE ends the game.
See "Ending the Game".


Replacing Your DUKES
--------------------------------------------------

<!-- this section is confusing. Like, the sequence of this information is unclear at a first read. -->

You may pick up your DUKES and exchange/replace them with cards from your hand.
You cannot replace DUKES that were taken by the opponent.

**The first player's first turn is a special case.**
On this turn, you can only exchange DUKES if you play the original DUKE in a run/set.
You cannot just pick up a DUKE and put it in your hand.

When you pick up a DUKE, you do not *have* to replace it.
If you leave it empty by the end of your turn, it is treated just as if the opponent took it.
The DUKE cannot be replaced on a later turn,
and if you leave both DUKES empty, you must flip up your CASTLE *at the start of your next turn.*

Finally, each turn, if your CASTLE is face-up and you have no DUKES, you may add back a single DUKE.
You cannot add back both of your DUKES,
and you cannot add new DUKES when your CASTLE is face-up.

You are not allowed to exchange your CASTLE.


Discarding
--------------------------------------------------

To end your turn, you must discard.
Cards are discarded face-down to your own discard pile.

There are four ways to discard:

1. Discard 1 card from your hand to the top of your discard pile.
2. Discard 2 cards from your hand to the top of your discard pile.
This can only be done if you perform no other actions during your turn.
You cannot play, exchange DUKES, or take the opponent's DUKES.
3. Discard 1 card from the top of your draw pile to the *bottom* of your discard pile.
You cannot look at it.
4. Discard 1 of *your own* cards from the play area to the top of your discard pile.
You can only do this if it leaves a valid arrangement of runs and sets behind.
Remember that runs/sets must be in a valid arrangement *before* you discard, as well.

Once you discard, your turn is over, and the other player may draw to start their turn.

You cannot look back through your discard pile.


Ending the Game
==================================================

In order to take an opponent's CASTLE, it must be face-up, and any DUKE guarding it must be taken in the same turn.
At this point, the game is over.
The attacking player gets a chance to play any additional cards from their hand before moving on to scoring.

Additionally, if a player empties both their draw and discard piles, meaning all of their cards are either on the table or in their hand, the game is over.
The attacking player gets a chance to play any additional cards from their hand before moving on to scoring.


Playing Your CASTLE
--------------------------------------------------

You may attempt to play your own CASTLE in order to take the opponent's and end the game.
Because you are playing your own CASTLE, you *must* take the opponent's in this turn.
You cannot end the game by only taking your own CASTLE.

To use your CASTLE, play it in runs/sets just like any other card.
If you are unable to take the opponent's CASTLE, you must return your CASTLE to its position, face-up.


Scoring
==================================================

At the end of the game, the player with the most cards on the table wins.
This includes runs/sets, remaining DUKES, and remaining CASTLES.
Any cards of your color are considered yours.
